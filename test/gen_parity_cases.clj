  "Stage 1 of the parity gate, on the JVM.

  Emits the cases *and the expected answers*, computed by
  `shugyo.policy/act-batch` — the oracle for what `a = W.obs + b` means in
  this workspace. Stage 2 (`test/policy_parity_test.cljs`) replays them
  against the real driver in a real browser.

  Two stages rather than one because the oracle cannot run where the browser
  can: `shugyo.policy` requires `shugyo.lcg`, which needs `goog.math.Long`,
  which nbb does not have. Running the oracle on the JVM — the host it is
  tested on — is the better half of that trade anyway.

  Cases are drawn from `shinka.rng`, so a failure is reproducible from its
  seed rather than from a saved blob."
