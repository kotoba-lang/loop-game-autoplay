  "Serves an unmodified game page with the agent driver injected.

  One server for both consumers, on purpose:

  - **Playwright** (training) loads it and calls `__autoplay.episode` over CDP.
  - **Safari on a booted iOS Simulator** (qualification) loads the *same* URL
    via `simctl openurl`, where there is no eval channel at all -- so the page
    has to start itself from the query string.

  If the two paths loaded different pages, the thing qualified on the phone
