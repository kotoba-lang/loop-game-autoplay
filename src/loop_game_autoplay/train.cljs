  "The training loop: `shinka` proposes genomes, a real browser scores them.

  ```
  nbb --classpath src:../shinka/src -m loop-game-autoplay.train \\
      --game ../../cloud-itonami/gameka/playtest/survivors-zombie.html \\
      --generations 12 --population 24 --episode-ms 60000 --seeds 3
  ```

  Training is headless and off-simulator, and that is a decision rather than
  a shortcut. A generation of 24 genomes x 3 seeds is 72 episodes; at 60 s of
  simulated time each that is 216,000 physics steps. Driving those through a
  phone would take hours of wall clock to produce the same numbers, because
  the Simulator renders every frame at real-time speed and cannot be told not
  to. The Simulator's job is to qualify the champion against real WebKit and
  produce the video -- see `loop-game-autoplay.qualify`.

  Everything is written as EDN. A run is evidence only if someone else can
  replay it: the champion carries its search seed, its evaluation seeds and
  its episode length, so `qualify` and any re-run start from stated inputs."
